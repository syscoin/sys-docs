First, it\u2019s important to understand that we view Bitcoin as the world\u2019s premier and most-proven secure means of decentralized self-sovereign digital ownership and transfer. That same decentralized security provided by Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work network of miners is extensible through a process called merged mining, which Satoshi himself created and introduced to Bitcoin Core in 2010. This means Bitcoin\u2019s network is capable of supporting far more than just storing and sending some BTC or an ordinal. In fact, technically it can already support everything Ethereum can, and more, without any Core protocol changes. However, for Bitcoin\u2019s network to tap into this, an appropriately designed merge-mined modular blockchain is required, and Bitcoin miners need to support it. This is where Syscoin comes in."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Syscoin also helps Bitcoin by incentivizing Bitcoin\u2019s miners with the utility coin $SYS.

However, there are important considerations here beyond just the distribution of hashrate supporting the chain. Ultimately, whether a merge-mined chain is secure depends upon that chain\u2019s own protocol. Syscoin is the first blockchain to make merged mining truly secure. This is accomplished by providing an additive layer of decentralized finality on top of the work of Bitcoin\u2019s miners. This is accomplished by a vast network of independently operated non-authoritative incentivized Sentry full nodes which participate in randomized multi-quorums to provide chainlocks. This actually makes Syscoin far more difficult to 51% attack or \u201cselfishly mine\u201d than Bitcoin itself while still keeping Bitcoin\u2019s own PoW at the bottom of the stack. Even if only a single pool mined Syscoin, an attack would still require that pool to control a supermajority of all Sentry nodes, a practically impossible achievement. This finality, which the Bitcoin parent-chain lacks, makes possible the unique data availability we provide to Bitcoin\u2019s community, and so much more that Syscoin provides.
