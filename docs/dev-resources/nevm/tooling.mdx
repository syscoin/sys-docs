# Tooling

Below are a list of tools that will be greatly beneficial to you when you're designing and creating the next big dApp!



**Truffle Suite**:

- **[Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)** - A world class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier.
- **[Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)** - A personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests. It is available as both a desktop application as well as a command-line tool (formerly known as the TestRPC). Ganache is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- **[Drizzle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/drizzle)** - A collection of front-end libraries that make writing dapp front-ends easier and more predictable. The core of Drizzle is based on a Redux store, so you have access to the spectacular development tools around Redux. We take care of synchronizing your contract data, transaction data and more.



**Hardhat**

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a more recently released development environment that has similarities to Truffle, it provides the ability to compile, deploy, test and debug solidity smart contracts.



**Remix IDE**
