# Tooling

Below are a list of tools that will be greatly beneficial to you when you're designing and creating the next big dApp!

**Hardhat**

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a modern JavaScript-based environment with tight plugin tooling for testing, debugging, and scripting. Reach for it when you want TypeScript support, rich task automation, or seamless integration with the ethers.js ecosystem.

**Foundry**

[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) is a Rust-native toolkit focused on speed and reproducibility, ideal if you prefer command-line workflows, fuzzing, or Solidity-first testing.

**Truffle (Discontinued)**

Truffle has been discontinued. We recommend using [Hardhat](./hardhat) or [Foundry](./foundry) for developing and deploying smart contracts on Syscoin NEVM.
