# Tooling

Below are a list of tools that will be greatly beneficial to you when you're designing and creating the next big dApp!



**Truffle Suite**:

- **[Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)** - A world class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier.
- **[Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)** - A personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests. It is available as both a desktop application as well as a command-line tool (formerly known as the TestRPC). Ganache is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- **[Drizzle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/drizzle)** - A collection of front-end libraries that make writing dapp front-ends easier and more predictable. The core of Drizzle is based on a Redux store, so you have access to the spectacular development tools around Redux. We take care of synchronizing your contract data, transaction data and more.



**Hardhat**

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a more recently released development environment that has similarities to Truffle, it provides the ability to compile, deploy, test and debug solidity smart contracts.



**Remix IDE**

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is an in-browser IDE that enables the writing, deploying and testing of smart contracts. It gives developers the ability to connect to any network they like through the use of browser extensions like MetaMask.
