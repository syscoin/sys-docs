**Truffle has been discontinued.** We recommend using [Hardhat](./hardhat) or [Foundry](./foundry) for developing and deploying smart contracts on Syscoin NEVM.

For a guide on migrating from Truffle to Hardhat, you can refer to this article: [Truffle is sunsetting — here’s how to migrate to Hardhat, Foundry, and thirdweb](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/truffle-alternative-ethereum/)
