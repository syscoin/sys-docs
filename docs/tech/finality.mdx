# Finality  
Decentralized and Fault Tolerant

Syscoin’s finality is sourced from a multi-quorum consisting of 4 groups of 400 masternodes (1,600 total) which are randomly selected among the entirety of Syscoin's network of masternodes (currently ~2,500 at time of documenting). Each quorum is reformed every few hours. 3 out of 4 quorums must agree on a block in order to establish a chainlock (finality).

This mechanism provides a high probability of finality in a decentralized way, and fault tolerance is inherited from the underlying Nakamoto consensus. In the rare event that finality cannot be achieved on a block, the network falls back to the longest chain rule - a seamless and non-breaking event.

|             |Time to finality after block|Blocktime   |Resilience absent finality        |Mechanism     |
| :-----------|----------------------------|------------|----------------------------------|--------------|
|**Syscoin**  |~12.5 minutes               |2.5 minutes |Nakamoto longest chain rule       |PoW + Quorums |
|**Ethereum** |~14 minutes (~3 epochs)     |10 seconds  |None. No finality = breaking event|PoS + Casper  |


Finality is established every five blocks through a chainlock, creating a checkpoint (about every 12.5 minutes based on average blocktime).

Syscoin’s finality provides effective resistance to 51%, malicious long-range MEV, and selfish mining attacks, while retaining PoW as the underlying consensus mechanism. Attackers must accomplish two expensive and challenging tasks to achieve a successful 51% attack: 1) Control greater than 50% of Bitcoin's hash power supplied to Syscoin, plus 2) Control a super-majority of Syscoin masternodes.
