#PoDA (Data Availability on Layer 1)    

Data availability is required to exist within the security domain of Layer 1 in order for rollups to properly serve critical financial applications by securing users’ ability to exit to L1. Syscoin’s L1 DA solution is called PoDA (Proof of Data Availability). Syscoin’s PoDA differs from Ethereum’s danksharding in how data is stored, presented, pruned, and how fees are calculated. PoDA has characteristics that make it a valuable alternative to Ethereum’s work-in-progress data availability solution, Proto-Danksharding.

PoDA’s advantages can be summarized as:

- Cheaper transactions
- No data sharding required
- Greater data throughput with efficient Keccak data blobs
- Secured by Bitcoin’s own PoW plus Syscoin's finality
- More resilient to network-based outages/censorship
- Simpler data fee market based on Syscoin’s UTXO fee market
- Nakamoto Assumption: Only one honest node is needed to guarantee data

PoDA’s design considers proving and archiving as separate concerns. With PoDA, the succinct proof of data is stored on Layer 1, while an assumption is made that at least one honest party in the world will archive the raw data within a 6-hour window of time - similar to the honesty assumption made when syncing a Bitcoin node (at least one honest node). If desired, the raw data itself can be secured by Syscoin’s L1 network by reposting the data every 6 hours.

Validium (fully offchain DA) is also available as an alternative to PoDA for less-critical applications where the focus might be on even lower cost and higher throughput by trading-off Layer 1 data security. However, in the case of Syscoin PoDA, Layer 1 data security is quite affordable and PoDA nodes can store raw data offchain if they wish while still gaining the security of onchain state and proving.

## Sample PoDA transaction

This PoDA transaction was submitted by Rollux L2 to the Syscoin Native (UTXO) testnet.    
**https://blockbook-dev.elint.services/tx/bae30de7850c370c77eb3590f631070d95c1a175323771fac5ab867fb1342136**  

Note: The Blockbook explorer does not currently parse the PoDA hash, but it is visible in the raw transaction data as scriptPubKey.asm: “OP_RETURN 20**7f262f3352669030f480dd881bc6b3fad68abfcffe81d8e98c7f3e88871ed3a4**”

The hash of the raw data blob is always stored on-chain for the purpose of proving data integrity, as seen above in the sample's OP_RETURN.

## How to interact with PoDA

**Syscoin Core (>=v4.4) provides an RPC interface that enables use of the PoDA protocol**

Once submitted, full raw data blobs are available within the native chain’s mempool for a period of six hours of finality before being pruned.  As long as the blob is in the mempool, archiving services can access and store it.  In the event that sufficient finality is absent, PoDA will retain blobs in the mempool until aforementioned finality threshold is met.  This helps ensure published data is given proper guarantees to solve fisherman's dilemma even during adverse network conditions. 

  
### `syscoincreatenevmblob`

Submit data blob with auto-generated Keccak256 versionHash (recommended)

```text
syscoincreatenevmblob "data" ( overwrite_existing conf_target "estimate_mode" fee_rate )

Arguments:
1. data                  (string, required) blob in hex
2. overwrite_existing    (boolean, optional, default=true) true to overwrite an existing blob if it exists, false to return versionhash of data on duplicate.
3. conf_target           (numeric, optional, default=wallet -txconfirmtarget) Confirmation target in blocks
4. estimate_mode         (string, optional, default="unset") The fee estimate mode, must be one of (case insensitive):
                         "unset"
                         "economical"
                         "conservative"
5. fee_rate              (numeric or string, optional, default=not set, fall back to wallet fee estimation) Specify a fee rate in sat/vB.

Examples:
> syscoin-cli syscoincreatenevmblob "data"
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "curltest", "method": "syscoincreatenevmblob", "params": ["data"]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8370/
```

  
### `syscoincreaterawnevmblob`

Submit data blob with custom (user-specified) versionHash. This might be useful if you wish to use a different hash algorithm or implement some custom commitment scheme as a layer on top of PoDA. Otherwise, it is best to stick with the `syscoincreatenevmblob` standard.

```text
syscoincreaterawnevmblob "versionhash" "data" ( conf_target "estimate_mode" fee_rate )

Arguments:
1. versionhash      (string, required) Version hash of the blob
2. data             (string, required) data in hex
3. conf_target      (numeric, optional, default=wallet -txconfirmtarget) Confirmation target in blocks
4. estimate_mode    (string, optional, default="unset") The fee estimate mode, must be one of (case insensitive):
                    "unset"
                    "economical"
                    "conservative"
5. fee_rate         (numeric or string, optional, default=not set, fall back to wallet fee estimation) Specify a fee rate in sat/vB.

Examples:
> syscoin-cli syscoincreaterawnevmblob "versionhash" "data" 6 economical 25
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "curltest", "method": "syscoincreaterawnevmblob", "params": ["versionhash" "data" 6 economical 25]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8370/
```

### `listnevmblobdata`

Retrieve a list of blobs from the UTXO mempool.

```text
listnevmblobdata ( count from {"getdata":bool} )

Arguments:
1. count                   (numeric, optional, default=10) The number of results to return.
2. from                    (numeric, optional, default=0) The number of results to skip.
3. options                 (json object, optional) A json object with options to filter results.
     {
       "getdata": bool,    (boolean, optional) Return data from blob
     }

Result:
[                             (json array)
  {                           (json object)
    "versionhash" : "hex",    (string) The version hash of the NEVM blob
    "datasize" : n,           (numeric) Size of data blob in bytes
    "data" : "hex"            (string) Blob data if getdata is true
  },
  ...
]

Examples:
> syscoin-cli listnevmblobdata 0
> syscoin-cli listnevmblobdata 10 10
> syscoin-cli listnevmblobdata 0 0 '{"getdata":true}'
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "curltest", "method": "listnevmblobdata", "params": [0, 0, '{"getdata":false}']}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8370/
```

### `getnevmblobdata`:

Retrieve a specific blob from the mempool by versionHash or txId

```text
getnevmblobdata "versionhash_or_txid" ( getdata )

Arguments:
1. versionhash_or_txid    (string, required) The version hash or txid of the NEVM blob
2. getdata                (boolean, optional) Optional, retrieve the blob data

```

## How to run a PoDA archiving node

Preface: PoDA's design is based on a separation of concerns between data availability and data archiving, with purpose being the former.

This means PoDA's purpose is to 1.) prove that data was made available to the public, and 2.) provide the on-chain basics (hash) to verify the integrity of any archived data.

Considering the above, archiving itself is left non-deterministic. Archivers can utilize Syscoin's Sentinel implementation below, or employ other means of archiving at their discretion. If decentralized archiving is a priority, there are a variety networks that provide this, such a KYVE, Filecoin, and others.

Syscoin **[Sentinel](https://github.com/syscoin/sentinel)** includes a PoDA archive client/server with out-of-the-box support for Filecoin/Lighthouse and Cloudflare R2 (supply your API keys)   
This is relatively easy to set up. Refer to the **[instructions](https://github.com/syscoin/sentinel#poda)** on GitHub.
