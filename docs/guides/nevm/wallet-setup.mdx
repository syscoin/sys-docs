# Prepare Your Syscoin Wallet

Before deploying or testing contracts you need a wallet that is configured for the Syscoin NEVM networks and funded with SYS (mainnet) or tSYS (testnet).

## Choose a wallet

- **Pali Wallet (recommended):** [Pali Wallet](https://paliwallet.com) is preconfigured for Syscoin NEVM Mainnet and Testnet, so you can skip the network setup steps below.
- **MetaMask:** Install the [MetaMask browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) or use an existing account, then add the Syscoin networks.

## Add the Syscoin NEVM networks

Use Chainlist to import the networks directly into your wallet:

| Network | Quick add |
| :-- | :-- |
| Syscoin NEVM Mainnet | [Add via Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/chain/57) |
| Syscoin NEVM Testnet (Tanenbaum) | [Add via Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/chain/5700) |

Approve the prompts in your wallet to finish the import. Some tools still label the Syscoin NEVM Testnet as “Tanenbaum”; both names point to the same chain.

### Manual settings (for MetaMask or other wallets)

Use these values if you need to enter the networks manually:

**Mainnet**

- Network Name: Syscoin NEVM Mainnet
- RPC URL: `https://rpc.syscoin.org`
- Chain ID: `57`
- Currency Symbol: `SYS`
- Block Explorer: `https://explorer.syscoin.org/`

**Testnet**

- Network Name: Syscoin NEVM Testnet
- RPC URL: `https://rpc.tanenbaum.io/`
- Chain ID: `5700`
- Currency Symbol: `tSYS`
- Block Explorer: `https://explorer.tanenbaum.io/`

## Fund the deployment account

Top up the account you plan to use for deployments:

- Follow the [official faucet instructions](https://support.syscoin.org/t/how-to-get-a-syscoin-faucet/876) for tSYS on testnet or SYS on mainnet.
- Exchanges or bridges can also provide SYS for mainnet deployments.

## Export the private key

Export the private key for the account that will sign your deployments, then store it in a secure secret manager or `.env` file referenced by Hardhat or Foundry.

**Keep credentials private:** never commit `.env` files and rotate the key immediately if it becomes exposed.
